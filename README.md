“Data Analysis project on vendor performance, profitability, and inventory management using statistical insights.”
# 📊 Vendor Performance Analysis  

## 🎯 Project Overview  
This project analyzes **vendor performance, inventory turnover, and profitability** in the retail/wholesale industry.  
The goal is to help businesses optimize profitability, reduce risks from vendor dependency, and improve operational efficiency.  

## 🛠 Tech Stack  
- **Python**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib/Seaborn  
- **SQL**: For querying and structured analysis  
- **Excel**: Data exploration and initial cleaning  
- **Snowflake (optional)**: For cloud-based data warehousing  
- **Statistics**: Hypothesis testing, correlation analysis  
- **Power BI**: Interactive dashboards for data storytelling & business insights  

## 📑 Business Problem  
Companies often face challenges like:  
- Underperforming brands dragging profitability.  
- Over-reliance on a few vendors.  
- High holding costs due to slow-moving inventory.  
- Profitability variance across vendors.  

This analysis focuses on solving these challenges with **data-driven insights**.  

## 🔎 Key Insights & Findings  
1. **Top Vendors Drive Sales**:  
   - Top 10 vendors contribute **65.7% of total purchases**, highlighting supply chain dependency risks.  

2. **Bulk Purchasing Advantage**:  
   - Vendors buying in large quantities enjoy a **72% lower unit cost** ($10.78 vs. higher costs in smaller orders).  

3. **Inventory Risks**:  
   - Slow-moving inventory locks **$2.71M of capital**, increasing holding costs.  

4. **Profitability Gaps**:  
   - High-performing vendors have ~31% margins.  
   - Low-performing vendors show ~41% margins but **struggle with volumes**, indicating pricing inefficiencies.  

5. **Statistical Validation**:  
   - Hypothesis testing confirmed a **significant difference** in profitability models between top and low-performing vendors.  

## 📊 Visual Insights  
- Correlation heatmaps for purchase, sales, and profitability.  
- Distribution plots of gross profit & profit margin.  
- Vendor-level comparison charts.  
- **Power BI Dashboard**: Interactive drill-downs for vendor sales, profit margin comparison, inventory turnover trends, and cost analysis.  

## 🚀 Recommendations  
- **Diversify vendor base** to reduce dependency on top 10 vendors.  
- **Optimize pricing strategies** for low-sales, high-margin brands.  
- **Leverage bulk purchasing** to maximize cost efficiency.  
- **Reduce unsold inventory** via clearance sales, demand forecasting, or optimized purchase orders.  
- **Boost marketing & distribution** for low-performing vendors.
